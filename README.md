I added a new folder called entities, this is where we will put the classes and interfaces

I will be uploading the Visual Studio solution either tonight or tomorrow, I'll call it NetQuax. All of the cshtml files should go into the views folder, css in the content folder, and our javascript in the file called app.js in the Scripts folder. Similarly, if we decide to add more models and controllers those will go in their respective folders.

I will also upload a folder for miscellaneous development files for the sql or any supporting documents.

I will be putting the requirements and design documents in the folder called tech docs so everything is in one place. I also put some c# coding references in the references folder, it's all very similar to java.
